This file is intended to run the Seldonian framework on the parent simulation data set as a single run, before scaling it into multiple trials. 

# Reading in the Data

First, let's read in the parent simulation data set.

```{r}
compas_sim_path <- "/home/dasienga24/Statistics-Senior-Honors-Thesis/Data Sets/COMPAS/compas_sim.csv"
compas_sim_parent <- read.csv(compas_sim_path)
```

# The Seldonian Algorithm {#chap-2}
<!--
This file is for including Chapter 2.  

Notice that it's also good practice to label your chapters and sections.  This will help you debug potential issues as you knit and allows you to link references throughout the document. Look for the reference to this chapter at the beginning of Chapter 3.

If labels aren't specified, they will automatically be generated from the header by changing the spaces to hyphens and capital letters to lowercase.

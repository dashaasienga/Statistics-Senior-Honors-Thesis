# The Seldonian Algorithm {#chap-2}

Chapter \@ref(intro) introduced the problem of algorithmic bias, discussed existing statistical definitions of fairness both in regression and classification settings, and finally, highlighted  fairness conflicts that can arise in certain settings. Of important note is that there are a plethora of fairness definitions that have been developed in statistical machine learning, many of which have been shown to be incompatible in ways similar to the illustration in Appendix \@ref(appendix-a). In any effort to enforce fairness on machine learning models, a critical first step is to define what fairness means in the specific context [@thomas2020housetestimony]. This responsibility falls on domain experts, social scientists, and regulators. Once there is consensus on that, machine learning researchers can work to develop appropriate algorithms that enforce the chosen definition of fairness. The Seldonian framework, introduced in this chapter, offers a way to place probablistic fairness constraints on traditional algorithms.

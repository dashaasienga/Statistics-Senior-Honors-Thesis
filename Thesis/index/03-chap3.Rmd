Chapter \@ref(chap-2) introduced the Seldonian framework, which offers probabilistic guarantees for satisfying defined behavioral constraints. Although impractical, the toy linear regression example demonstrated how Seldonian algorithms may be employed in a setting with a continuous real-valued response variable.

However, machine learning algorithms deal with classification problems in many practical applications. Applications range from risk assessment tools like COMPAS, discussed in Chapter \@ref(intro), to credit scoring and employment prediction algorithms, to name a few. However, deploying such algorithms raises significant ethical concerns, as discussed in Chapters \@ref(intro) and \@ref(chap-2), primarily regarding fairness and the potential reinforcement of discriminatory practices. Given the historical and social biases inherent in the data used to train these algorithms, there is a pressing need to assess their fairness and mitigate any potential harm they may cause disadvantaged groups.

To offer a path forward in addressing this issue, this chapter aims to apply the Seldonian framework to the COMPAS data set and assess its predictive outcomes compared to those from the COMPAS tool and those from logistic regression, a standard ML procedure. Specifically, the objective is to assess whether Seldonian approaches can produce fairer outcomes, particularly COMPAS outcomes, drawing on some of the statistical definitions of fairness defined in Chapter \@ref(fairnessdefinitions). This chapter will present a framework that can be emulated in other classification problems where fairness is a concern. 


## The COMPAS Data Set

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# read in the data
compas_path <- "/home/dasienga24/Statistics-Senior-Honors-Thesis/Data Sets/COMPAS/compas_data.csv"
compasdata <- read.csv(compas_path)

# clean the data
compasdata <- compasdata %>%
  filter(decile_score > 0 & is_recid != -1 & days_b_screening_arrest >= -30 &
           days_b_screening_arrest <= 30) %>%
  mutate(days_b_screening_arrest = abs(days_b_screening_arrest))

# remove duplicates
clean_compasdata <- compasdata[-which(duplicated(compasdata$id)), ]
```

The COMPAS data set, obtained from the ProPublica Data Store [@compasdata], records information on defendants from Broward County, Florida, that were evaluated for the risk of recidivism by the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) tool in 2013 and 2014. A database hosts this data, and a SQL query, displayed in Appendix \@ref(appendix-c), retrieved 12160 observations. There are 29 variables, 6 of which were identified to be useful for this predictive analysis: age, age category, sex, marital status, whether the defendant had a history of juvenile offenses or not, and the total number of prior offenses committed by the defendant. The response variable records whether or not a defendant had recommitted a crime within two years. Finally, the protected attribute, race, has six levels: African-American, Caucasian, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, and Other. After cleaning the data to address anomalies, improve the data quality, and remove duplicate observations, the data set size was reduced to 9387 observations. Section \@ref(descriptivestats) examines these variables in more detail and their relationships with each other.

## Descriptive Statistics {#descriptivestats}

### Univariate Analysis {#univariateanalysis}

The six predictive variables are age, age category, sex, marital status, whether the defendant had a history of juvenile offenses, and the total number of prior offenses committed by the defendant. Only two variables are continuous: the number of prior offenses and the defendant's age. The remaining variables are categorical.

#### Continuous Predictors

The defendants' ages range from 18 to 96, with a median of 32 years and a mean of 34.75 years. There is a right skew, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:ch3fig1), and the middle 50% of the defendants are between the ages of 25 and 42. Similarly, the variable recording the number of prior offenses has a significant right skew with a median of 1 offense and a mean of 3.02 offenses. The middle 50% of the defendants have committed between 0 and 4 offenses, and the defendant with the most prior offenses has committed 38 crimes. Figure \@ref(fig:ch3fig1) visualizes this distribution.

```{r ch3fig1, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Distribution of the COMPAS Continuous Variables", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3, echo = FALSE}
g1 <- ggplot(data = clean_compasdata, mapping = aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Age")

g2 <- ggplot(data = clean_compasdata, mapping = aes(x = priors_count)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "priors",
       title = "Prior Offenses")

grid.arrange(g1, g2, nrow = 1)
```


#### Categorical Predictors

Sex has two levels: male and female. There are 7457 males and 1930 females in the data set. The age category variable classifies participants as either 'Less than 25', '25 - 45', or 'Greater than 45' -- there are 2009, 5366, and 2012 observations in each group, respectively. There are seven different levels of marital status. In descending order, they are single (7202), married (1138), divorced (398), significant other (332), separated (219), unknown (58), and widowed (40). Finally, 8254 defendants had no record of juvenile offenses, with only 1133 defendants having such a record. Figure \@ref(fig:ch3fig2) visually displays the distribution of these variables.

```{r ch3fig2, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Distribution of the COMPAS Categorical Variables", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, echo = FALSE}
g3 <- ggplot(data = clean_compasdata, mapping = aes(x = sex)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Sex")

order <- c("Less than 25", "25 - 45", "Greater than 45")

g4 <- ggplot(data = clean_compasdata, mapping = aes(x = age_cat)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = order) +
  labs(x = "Age Category",
       title = "Age Categories")

g5 <- ggplot(data = clean_compasdata, mapping = aes(x = marital_status)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25, vjust = 1.2, hjust=1)) +
  labs(x = "Marital Status",
       title = "Marital Status") 

clean_compasdata <- clean_compasdata %>%
  mutate(juv_offense_count = juv_fel_count + juv_misd_count + juv_other_count,
         juv_offense = ifelse(juv_offense_count == 0, 0, 1))

g6 <- clean_compasdata %>%
  mutate(juv_offense = ifelse(juv_offense == 0, "No", "Yes")) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = juv_offense)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Committed a Juvenile Offense",
       title = "Juvenile Offense Record")

grid.arrange(g3, g4, g6, g5, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)

```


#### Response Variable

The response variable records whether or not a defendant recommitted any crime within two years. Figure \@ref(fig:ch3fig3) illustrates that about two-thirds (6199) of the defendants did not recommit a crime within two years, while one-third (3188) did. The different proportion of observations in each level indicates class imbalance, which often affects the performance of machine learning classification algorithms. Given the class imbalance, analyzing performance relative to the classes will be important when assessing model performance in the proceeding sections. 

```{r ch3fig3, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Distribution of the COMPAS Response Variable: Recidivism", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 4.5, fig.height = 2.5, echo = FALSE}
clean_compasdata %>%
mutate(is_recid = ifelse(is_recid == 0, "No", "Yes")) %>%
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = is_recid)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Recidivism",
       x = "Recommitted a Crime Within 2 Years")
```

#### Demographic Variable

Finally, the demographic variable in this analysis is race. Most of the defendants are African-American (4674) and Caucasian (3250), with only 818 Hispanic, 48 Asian, and 27 Native American defendants. The remaining 570 defendants identify as 'Other'. Figure \@ref(fig:ch3fig4) visualizes this.

```{r ch3fig4, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Distribution of the COMPAS Demographic Variable: Race", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 4.5, fig.height = 2.5, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = clean_compasdata, mapping = aes(x = race)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25, vjust = 1.2, hjust=1)) +
  labs(title = "Race")
```

### Bivariate Analysis {#bivariateanalysis}

With a thorough understanding of the variables from Section \@ref(univariateanalysis), this section examines the relationship between the predictive variables and the response variable, recidivism.

#### Continuous Predictors

There is some difference in the mean and median ages for defendants who recommit crimes within two years versus those who do not. Those who recidivate have a mean and median age of 32 and 29, respectively, compared to 36 and 33 for those who do not. Defendants who recidivate tend to be younger than those who do not, as illustrated by the boxplot in Figure \@ref(fig:ch3fig5). There is also some distributional difference in non-juvenile prior offenses for defendants who recidivate versus those who do not, as is indicated by different means and medians. Those who recommit a crime within two years tend to have more prior offenses, with a mean of 4.7 and median of 3, compared to a mean of 2.2 and a median of 1 offense for defendants who do not. Figure \@ref(fig:ch3fig5) visualizes this distributional difference.

```{r ch3fig5, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Distribution of the COMPAS Continuous Variables by Recidivism", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 3, echo = FALSE}
g7 <- clean_compasdata %>%
  mutate(is_recid = ifelse(is_recid == 0, "No", "Yes")) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = is_recid, y = age)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Recidivism by Age",
       x = "Recidivism",
       y = "Age")

g8 <- clean_compasdata %>%
  mutate(is_recid = ifelse(is_recid == 0, "No", "Yes")) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = is_recid, y = priors_count)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Recidivism by Prior Offenses",
       x = "Recidivism",
       y = "Prior Offenses")

grid.arrange(g7, g8, nrow = 1)
```


#### Categorical Predictors

Figure \@ref(fig:ch3fig6) displays the relationship between the four categorical variables -- sex, age category, marital status, and juvenile offense record -- and the response variable. There is not much evident relationship between sex and recidivism. Among defendants who do not recidivate, more are 45 years old compared to those under 25. However, among those who recidivated, more defendants are less than 25 compared to those greater than 45. There is not much relationship between recidivism and marital status. Finally, while most defendants do not have juvenile offenses, the proportion of those who do not to those who do is much smaller for defendants who re-offend in comparison to those who do not.

```{r ch3fig6, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Distribution of the COMPAS Categorical Variables by Recidivism", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4.5, echo = FALSE}
g9 <- ggplot(data = clean_compasdata, mapping = aes(x = sex, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~is_recid) +
  labs(title = "Recidivism by Sex") 

order <- c("Less than 25", "25 - 45", "Greater than 45")

g10 <- ggplot(data = clean_compasdata, 
       mapping = aes(x = age_cat, fill = age_cat)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~is_recid) +
  labs(title = "Recidivism by Age Categories",
       x = "Age Category",
       fill = "Age Category") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25, vjust = 1.2, hjust=1)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = order) 

g11 <- ggplot(data = clean_compasdata, 
       mapping = aes(x = marital_status, fill = marital_status)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~is_recid) +
  labs(title = "Recidivism by Marital Status",
       x = "Marital Status",
       fill = "Marital Status") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25, vjust = 1.2, hjust=1))

g12 <- clean_compasdata %>%
  mutate(juv_offense = ifelse(juv_offense == 0, "No", "Yes")) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = juv_offense, fill = juv_offense)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~is_recid) +
  labs(title = "Recidivism by Juvenile Offense",
       x = "Juvenile Offense",
       fill = "Juvenile Offense") 

grid.arrange(g10, g12, nrow = 2)
```

### Multivariate Analysis

```{r, echo = FALSE}
compas_final <- clean_compasdata %>%
  dplyr::select(c(race, sex, age, age_cat, marital_status, 
                  juv_offense, priors_count,
                  decile_score, is_recid))
```


As detailed in Section \@ref(bivariateanalysis), some predictive variables have a covariate relationship with the response variable, recidivism. A scatterplot matrix examining the relationship between the continuous variables, age and prior offenses, revealed weak correlations $(\rho = 0.12)$ and nonlinear relationships. There are no significant concerns for multicollinearity. Figure \@ref(fig:ch3fig7) illustrates this using Spearman's correlation. In addition, the correlation matrix incorporates the COMPAS tool decile scores to examine the predictive relationship between the continuous variables and the COMPAS tool results. The COMPAS tool maps raw scores into decile scores ranging from 1 to 10. The decile scores are directly associated with the risk of recidivism: scores between 1 and 4 are labeled as 'low' risk, between 5 and 7 as 'medium' risk, and between 8 and 10 as 'high risk'. Spearman's correlation revealed a moderate relationship of $\rho = -0.44$ and $\rho = 0.44$ for age and prior offenses, respectively.

```{r ch3fig7, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Spearman's Correlation Matrix for COMPAS Predictive Variables and the COMPAS Tool Decile Scores", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 4.5, fig.height = 3, echo = FALSE}
mycordata3 <- compas_final %>%
  dplyr::rename("Age" = age,
         "Priors" = priors_count,
         "Decile Scores" = decile_score) %>%
  dplyr::select("Age", "Priors", "Decile Scores")

mycors <- round(cor(mycordata3, method = "spearman"),2)
mycorplot <- melt(mycors)

ggplot(data = mycorplot, aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "",
       title = "Spearman's Correlation Matrix") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(
    low = "blue",
    high = "red",
    mid = "white",
    midpoint = 0,
    limit = c(-1, 1),
    space = "Lab",
    name = "Spearman\nCorrelation"
  ) +
  geom_text(aes(Var2, Var1, label = value),
            color = "black",
            size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))

```

With a thorough understanding of the variables, Section \@ref(fairnessanalysis) analyzes the data set and the COMPAS tool decile scores with a focus on fairness and an aim to examine the fairness concerns discussed in Chapters \@ref(chap-1) and \@ref(chap-2).

## Fairness Analysis {#fairnessanalysis}

Chapter \@ref(algbias) introduced algorithmic bias as a situation when an algorithm’s decisions are skewed towards a particular group of people, either positively or negatively. With race as the protected attribute, this section aims to examine the COMPAS tool results, the underlying proxy relationships between the variables and the sensitive attribute, race, and create a table similar to the one in Figure \@ref(fig:compas1), which highlights the discrepancy in false positive and false negative rates of the COMPAS tool for Black and White defendants. 

### COMPAS Tool Analysis {#comptoolanalysis}

Recall that COMPAS decile scores of 1 to 4 are mapped as 'low' risk, 5 to 7 as 'medium' risk, and 8 to 10 as 'high' risk. The median decile score for the entire data set is four, and Figure \@ref(fig:ch3fig8) illustrates that the COMPAS tool classifies more than half of the defendants as low risk. In particular, the tool classifies 5370 as low risk and 1677 as high risk, with the remaining 2340 as medium risk. These predictions align with expectations since most defendants did not recommit a crime within the two-year time window, as observed in Figure \@ref(fig:ch3fig3). 

```{r ch3fig8, fig.align='center', fig.cap="COMPAS Tool Decile Scores", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 4.5, fig.height = 4, echo = FALSE}

order <- c("Low", "Medium", "High")

g14 <- ggplot(data = clean_compasdata, mapping = aes(x = score_text)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = order) +
  labs(x = "COMPAS Risk Prediction",
       title = "COMPAS Risk Predictions in the Data Set")

g15 <- ggplot(data = clean_compasdata, mapping = aes(x = as.factor(decile_score))) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "COMPAS Decile Score",
       title = "Decile Scores in the COMPAS Data Set")

grid.arrange(g14, g15)
```

However, when these scores are broken down by whether the defendant reoffended within two years, it is revealed that the COMPAS tool performs poorly in classifying participants who recidivate. Such participants are classified almost equally into the three risk categories: low, medium, and high. Furthermore, while most defendants who do not reoffend within two years are classified as low risk, a significant number of them are classified as 'medium' and 'high' risk. Furthermore, the decile scores of defendants who recidivate and those who do not range from 1 to 10, although the median decile score is 6 for the former group and 3 for the latter group. Generally, these results raise concerns about the COMPAS tool's predictive performance. 

```{r ch3fig9, fig.align='center', fig.cap="COMPAS Tool Decile Scores by Recidivism", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.width = 4.5, fig.height = 2.5, echo = FALSE}
order <- c("Low", "Medium", "High")
  
clean_compasdata %>%
  mutate(is_recid = ifelse(is_recid == 0, "No", "Yes")) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = score_text, fill = score_text)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~is_recid) +
  labs(title = "Recidivism by COMPAS Risk Score",
       x = "COMPAS Risk Score",
       fill = "COMPAS Risk Score") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25, vjust = 1.2, hjust=1)) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = order) 

```

A breakdown by race, the protected attribute, will allow for further analysis of the performance of the COMPAS tool. To convert this into a binary prediction problem, decile scores of 1 to 5 will be mapped as 'lower' risk, while those ranging from 6 to 10 will be mapped as 'higher' risk. 

[proceed from COMPAS Analysis section. work backwards: general FNR/ FPR --> accuracy --> race FNR/ FPR --> results and highlights of algorithmic bias]

### Proxy Relationships 

The COMPAS tool is a race-blind model; race was not included as a variable. Yet,
Section \@ref(comptoolanalysis) revealed that the resulting predictions exhibit significant racial discrepancies. This section analyzes the relationship between race and the predictive variables to examine how much information regarding a defendant's race is incorporated into the model via other variables.

#### Continuous Variables

For all the races, there are more male defendants than female defendants. However, African-American defendants tend to be, on average, the youngest compared to all the other races. Asian defendants, followed by Caucasian defendants, tend to be the oldest. Nevertheless, there is considerable overlap among all the races, and the relationships is visualized in Figure ....
